I am used to present the results of type inference to a developer. 
I have  different models to represent:
variableModel - you can select a variable of interest
assModel - you can get all the assignments of the newly created objects to the variable selected in the variable model
selectorModel - you can see all the messages sent to the variable selected in the variable model
hierModel - you can see the roots of hierarhies to which the selected variable can belong
classModel - you can see all the possible classes for the variable order by a heuristic
