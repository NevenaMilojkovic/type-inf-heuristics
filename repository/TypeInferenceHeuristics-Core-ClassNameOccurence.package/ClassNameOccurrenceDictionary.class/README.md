I represent a dictionary of class name occurrences in the image.
I have an instance variable on the class side named 'dictionary' which holds the information of how many times each of the classes has been mentionned in the image.
Keys are class names, i.e. objects of type ByteSymbol, and values are integers.
I am constantly updated through the announcements.
